# ðŸ’¾ CHIP-8 Emulator ðŸ‘¾
### What works
As of now, the emulator is far to be completed. The only thing that currently works is the CPU module, which allows to run a few visual demos 
(i.e. the famous IBM logo one) that can be run in every UTF-8 supporting shell emulator thanks to a temporary CLI implementation of the display.   

### Next steps
Now that the CPU module is almost completely working, the next milestones for this project are the following:
- Implementing an SDL2 GUI
- Making the emulator capable to detect inputs
- Implementing a sound module
